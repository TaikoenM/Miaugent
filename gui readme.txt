ERROR: Error messages only
Tips
Watch the Logs: The log panel provides valuable information about what's happening
Save Your Work: Use File > Save Workflow regularly to preserve your progress
Check Status Bar: The status bar shows current operation status
Use Filters: Filter logs by severity to focus on important messages
Keyboard Navigation: Use Tab to move between fields
Troubleshooting
GUI Won't Start
Ensure all dependencies are installed
Check that Python tkinter is available: python -m tkinter
Operations Fail
Check the log panel for error messages
Ensure your OpenAI API key is set (if using OpenAI)
Verify file paths are correct
Slow Performance
Long operations run in background threads
Progress bar indicates ongoing operations
Check logs for detailed progress information
Requirements
Python 3.7+
tkinter (usually comes with Python)
All dependencies from the main project
